# The Brief:  
  
Kotlin messaging app.  
  
## Description  
  
Hiya is a messaging service. It was originally built like any other messaging app (e.g. WhatsApp) but my goals have changed. Now, it will allow users to work with their friends to build fictional stories one word at a time. The project is in an early stage of development.  

The final project will utilise most (if not, all) of the following libraries/features:  
* Firebase (for authentication and recording user information)  
* MVVM architecture
* View Models
* Coroutines
* Room
* Android's Navigation Component
* Recycler View

Stay tuned for further updates!
